State: Redux Store

Throughout this module, you learned how to manage global state using React’s Context API. The Context API is quickly gaining traction in the development world as a worthy alternative or perhaps even successor to additional libraries that have been used to manage global state in tandem with React, such as Flux or MobX. In spite of this, Redux remains the industry standard for managing complex state in a large-scale React application, and it’s very likely that you’ll encounter it while working as a developer.


## User Story

```md
AS a senior engineer on an e-commerce platform
I WANT my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API
SO THAT my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem
```
